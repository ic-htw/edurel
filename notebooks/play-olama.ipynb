      " Given the natural language question, we have three tables and each table is linked with relations defined in foreign keys. The question itself does not explicitly mention what data it needs; however, from the context given about tables and their relations, it seems we should use all of them to extract a meaningful answer for any specific project or organization structure. In case we are required to show some details on an organization unit's hierarchy, employee salaries, projects associated with employees’ hours per week, or bonus plans, then the combination of these tables would be necessary.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "Now onto translating that into SQL.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Understand Natural Language Question\n",
      "The question is asking for a solution but it’s not provided. Hence we should consider it could refer to various scenarios such as getting organizational structure data combined with employee projects and salaries. Since no specific detail was given, let's assume the question needs basic organization details along with project association and hours worked by employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Extract Required Tables\n",
      "We are dealing with four tables in total from the schema given.\n",
      "- `Employee`\n",
      "- `OrgUnit` for organizational structure details like hierarchy or departmental structure\n",
      "- `Project` for project information\n",
      "- `EmpProj` for connecting employee-project association and hours worked\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Joining Tables\n",
      "From the reference solution, it is evident that joining tables based on their foreign keys (`EID`, `PID`, `OUID`) is needed.\n",
      "- Connect `Employee` to `OrgUnit` using `OUID`.\n",
      "- Connect `EmpProj` with `Employee` and `Project` respectively by matching `EID` and `PID`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Selecting Columns\n",
      "Let's assume, for instance purposes, we want a view of an organization unit details (name) along with employees’ salaries and bonus, the projects they worked on, and number of hours per week spent in those projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "```sql\n",
      "SELECT \n",
      "    O.Name AS OrgUnitName,\n",
      "    E.LastName,\n",
      "    E.Salary,\n",
      "    E.Bonus,\n",
      "    P.Title AS ProjectTitle,\n",
      "    EP.NoOfHoursPerWeek\n",
      "FROM Employee E\n",
      "INNER JOIN OrgUnit O ON E.OUID = O.OUID\n",
      "INNER JOIN EmpProj EP ON E.EID = EP.EID\n",
      "INNER JOIN Project P ON EP.PID = P.PID;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Finalize Query\n",
      "Based on our assumption, here's a complete SQL query that aligns with the schema and avoids unnecessary selections as per common practices. \n",
      "\n",
      "```sql\n",
      "SELECT \n",
      "    O.Name AS OrgUnitName,\n",
      "    E.LastName,\n",
      "    E.Salary,\n",
      "    E.Bonus,\n",
      "    P.Title AS ProjectTitle,\n",
      "    EP.NoOfHoursPerWeek\n",
      "FROM Employee E\n",
      "INNER JOIN OrgUnit O ON E.OUID = O.OUID\n",
      "INNER JOIN EmpProj EP ON E.EID = EP.EID\n",
      "INNER JOIN Project P ON EP.PID = P.PID;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "This query joins the necessary tables and selects relevant columns ensuring no unnecessary data is selected and all conditions from foreign keys are appropriately used. It delivers a structured view of organization units alongside pertinent employee-project associations, salary details, bonuses, project titles, and weekly hours worked per project.\n"
